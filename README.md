Hello World!

I've edited my Git Hub Readme.
Sincerely,

Paul J Loehlein

Heyo, I love disc golfing, skateboards, video games, computer hardware, dogs, and life. I'm very active and outgoing, I'm constantly doing something with somebody. I love coding because it's like the best kind of problem solving (relatively low stress imo). And yeah. That's me.
