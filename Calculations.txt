BMI (Body Mass Index): 
	Kilograms/meters^2

BMR (Basal Medabolic Rate): 
	Women: BMR = 655 + ( 4.35 x weight in pounds ) + ( 4.7 x height in inches ) - ( 4.7 x age in years ) 
	Men: BMR = 66 + ( 6.23 x weight in pounds ) + ( 12.7 x height in inches ) - ( 6.8 x age in years )
		Sedentary (little or no exercise): BMR x 1.2
		Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week): BMR x 1.375
		Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week): BMR x 1.55
		Very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week): BMR x 1.725
		Extra active (very hard exercise/sports & physical job or 2x training): BMR x 1.9
